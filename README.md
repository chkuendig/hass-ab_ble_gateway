#  April Brother (AB) BLE Gateway V4 Component
This component allows forwarding  BLE data from the AB BLE Gateway V4 to the new [bluetooth component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/) released in Home Assistant [2022.8](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2022/08/03/release-20228/#first-class-bluetooth-support).

AB BLE Gateway V4 is an ESP32- and NRF52832-based BLE to network gateway and bridge. It reads BLE advertsiment data such as iBeacon, Eddystone or customized format data and sends to LAN/internet server (via MQTT, HTTP or Websockets). It's widely distributed through AliExpress, Amazon, Taobao etc. For more information, see the [April Brother Wiki](https://wiki.aprbrother.com/en/AB_BLE_Gateway_V4.html). 

Please note that this component only supports forwarding  via MQTT.


## Component Setup Instructions
The component should automatically discover any devices on the network (the gateway advertises itself via SSDP).

Please make sure to have setup the [MQTT component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) and have it configured to the same queue and server as in the Gateway config.

The compoennt supports authenticated login and automatically checks that the MQTT settings match. 


## Configuration of the Gateway
The easiest and most portable way to configure the gateway is through the  electron based configuration tool at [AprilBrother/gw4-config-tool](https://github.com/AprilBrother/gw4-config-tool). You'll need to have node + npm installed to run it.

1. Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/AprilBrother/gw4-config-tool.git
cd gw4-config-tool 
```
2. Install configuration tool incl. dependencies
```
npm i .
```
3. Launch 
```
npm start
```

**Note:** The configuration tool should find the gateway automatically (interestingly enough this happens by enumerating the whole subnet instead of using the SSDP broadcast... ðŸ™„)
